## Program output:

`
It took 31 milliseconds to initialize ArrayList and 48 milliseconds to initialize LinkedList
The fastest result was for ArayList
In my 10 experiments LinkedList was faster 9 times and ArrayList was faster only 1 time
-------------------------------------------------------------------
For ArrayList it takes:
43 ms. to add elements on the beginning;
18 ms. to add elements on the middle;
0 ms. to add elements on the end

The fastest way to add elements to ArrayList: beginning
-------------------------------------------------------------------
For LinkedList it takes:
1 ms. to add elements on the beginning;
272 ms. to add elements on the middle;
0 ms. to add elements on the end

The fastest way to add elements to LinkedList: beginning and end of list
-------------------------------------------------------------------
For ArrayList it takes:
0 ms. to update elements on the beginning;
0 ms. to update elements on the middle;
0 ms. to update elements on the end

The fastest point to update elements to ArrayList: anywhere
-------------------------------------------------------------------
For LinkedList it takes:
0 ms. to update elements on the beginning;
275 ms. to update elements on the middle;
8 ms. to update elements on the end

The fastest point to update elements to LinkedList: begining and end of list
-------------------------------------------------------------------
For ArrayList it takes:
43 ms. to delete elements on the beginning;
19 ms. to delete elements on the middle;
0 ms. to delete elements on the end

The fastest point to delete elements to ArrayList: anywhere
-------------------------------------------------------------------
For LinkedList it takes:
0 ms. to delete elements on the beginning;
280 ms. to delete elements on the middle;
11 ms. to delete elements on the end

The fastest point to delete elements to LinkedList: begining and end of list
